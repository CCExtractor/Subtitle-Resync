 What are you doing? It's 11pm. 

2754
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:35,059
        I can explain...        

2755
02:05:35,095 --> 02:05:37,161
    You should be out there     
   disappointing your father.   

2756
02:05:37,197 --> 02:05:40,365
 I need to clean this place up. 

2757
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,734
          Bloopy, bad           
      judgement and loopy.      

2758
02:05:42,769 --> 02:05:44,269
     Hunger keeps inventing     
         new problems,          

2759
02:05:44,304 --> 02:05:46,437
         so we invented         
       SNICKERS® Crisper.       

2760
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:33,184
     On September 9, 2010,      

2761
02:06:33,219 --> 02:06:36,821
PG&E learned a tragic lesson we 
       can never forget.        

2762
02:06:36,856 --> 02:06:39,490
 This gas pipeline ruptured in  
           San Bruno.           

2763
02:06:39,526 --> 02:06:42,160
 The explosion and fire killed  
         eight people.          

2764
02:06:42,195 --> 02:06:45,496
PG&E was convicted of six felony
       charges including        

2765
02:06:45,532 --> 02:06:48,666
  five violations of the U.S.   
    Pipeline Safety Act and     

2766
02:06:48,702 --> 02:06:51,002
      obstructing an NTSB       
         investigation.         

2767
02:06:51,037 --> 02:06:54,172
PG&E was fined, placed under an 
        outside monitor,        

2768
02:06:54,207 --> 02:06:55,840
 given five years of probation, 

2769
02:06:55,875 --> 02:06:59,510
 and required to perform 10,000 
  hours of community service.   

2770
02:06:59,546 --> 02:07:01,512
      We are deeply sorry.      

2771
02:07:01,548 --> 02:07:04,015
  We failed our customers in    
           San Bruno.           

2772
02:07:04,050 --> 02:07:06,684
  While an apology alone will   
        never be enough,        

2773
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:09,354
  actions can make PG&E safer.  

2774
02:07:09,389 --> 02:07:10,688
 And that's why we've replaced  

2775
02:07:10,724 --> 02:07:13,024
    hundreds of miles of gas    
           pipeline,            

2776
02:07:13,059 --> 02:07:15,193
   adopted new leak detection
