= Installing Dependencies

I have tried to keep very less dependencies. The project
**co_oCCur** uses three libraries which are statically linked.
It has just a couple of dependencies which makes using it extremely easy.
Once the requirements are met, using the tool is trivial.

== CMAKE

CMake minimum version *3.10* is required.

CMake can be installed using default system package manager or by getting binaries from
https://cmake.org/download/[here].

You can refer the easy steps on https://cgold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-step/installation.html[readthedocs].

== Boost Libraries

Boost minimum version *1.65* is required.

To be precise, we need the following Boost libraries:

- system
- filesystem

You can follow https://theboostcpplibraries.com/introduction-installation[this].

*Ubuntu*

    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev


== FFmpeg
FFmpeg is not a requirement of the project, but it can be used to convert the media files to the
project-specific audio (.wav) files.

I had some issues installing it. Using https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide[this], you won't.

After installing, we can run `ffmpeg` with following arguments to convert the media file to the desired audio format.

    ffmpeg -i path/to/input/video.ts -acodec pcm_s16le -ac 1 -ar 16000 /output/audio/name.wav
