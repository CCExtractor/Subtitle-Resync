= Usage

Obviously, before we use the tool we need to install it, https://github.com/sypai/co-oCCUr/tree/master/docs/installing_dependencies.adoc[this] installation
guide here will help you do so. Once we have the tool installed this guide
is all we need to use it to our purpose.

== CCExtractor
CCExtractor, the de-facto subtitle tool, can be used to extract
the subtitles from the original files.

Using CCExtractor:

    ccextractor [options] inputfile1 [inputfile2...] [-o outputfilename]

Everything about CCExtractor can be found https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor[here].

== FFmpeg
The tools require the audio to be in specific format. The audio needs to be
raw PCM(16-bit signed int). It should be mono(single channel) sampled at 16KHz.

Converting any media to the specified format can be achieved using `ffmpeg`.

    ffmpeg -i /path/to/video.ts -acodec pcm_s16le -ac 1 -ar 16000 output/path/name.wav

== Using co_oCCur

Running co_oCCur without any instruments lists all the parameters that are to be passed.

- Syntax

    ./co_oCCur -tool [tool options] <tool specific arguments>

- Using Tool A [Current status: COMPLETE]

We need 3 files to be passed to the tool. One is the original/reference file, an edited file and the original subtitle for the original/reference file.

    ./co_oCCur -t A -o /path/to/original/audio.wav -m /path/to/modified/audio.wav -s /path/to/original/subtitle.srt


- Using Tool B [Current status: Incomplete]

We need 3 files to be passed to the tool. One is the original/reference file, an edited file and the original subtitle for the original/reference file.

    ./co_oCCur -t B /path/to/modified/audio.wav -s /path/to/original/subtitle.srt
